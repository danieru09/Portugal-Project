        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Portugal’s history stretches back over 2,000 years, beginning with ancient Celtic tribes and Roman rule. It became a global maritime power in the 15th and 16th centuries during the Age of Discovery, establishing trade routes and colonies across Africa, Asia, and South America. The legacy of this era still influences its culture, architecture, and national pride today.</p>
